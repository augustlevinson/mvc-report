Unit tests have been implemented to ensure the logic of the different games and other pages is functioning as expected. The project also demonstrates the use of MVC architecture, promoting a well-structured and maintainable codebase - although the controllers lower the test coverage score.


Project
===

As the finishing project of the course I made a simple implementation of a BlackJack card game. The project is built with object oriented PHP, Symfony, and Twig.
See it live <a href="https://www.student.bth.se/~aule23/dbwebb-kurser/mvc/me/report/public/proj">here</a>.
