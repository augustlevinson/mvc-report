    <strong>The functionality for this part of the website</strong> is structured into classes Card, DeckOfCards, DeckOfCardsWithJokers. the Card class holds an individual playing card and DeckOfCards holds a complete deck of cards (each card being a Card object). DeckOfCardsWithJokers is a sub class of DeckOfCards, inheriting all variables and methods from that class. This extension adds the possibility to use a deck containing jokers.
